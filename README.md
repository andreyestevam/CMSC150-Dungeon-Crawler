# Dungeon Crawler
Welcome! This repository maintains your game project!

## Project Components

In this project, you will develop your game in Python and *document* its design and how to play it.
All components will be placed into this repository and will evolve during the semester.

Documentation will be written in markdown, a very simple markup language that Github renders as webpages.
The Github [markdown reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) is clutch!

You will see in this repository a `requirements.txt` file.
This file holds onto the libraries that your game needs to run.
If you ever need new libraries, you add them into this file.
