# Welcome
This is a dungeon crawler style game, which was a project for my first Computer Science class in college (CMSC 150: Introduction to Computing). I learned Python for the first time while making this game.

## About the game

The name of the game is "Richmond Chainsaw Massacre", which is about three Senior Computer Science majors that failed a class, so they could not graduate and get a job, and since they are very upset, they want to make everyone also fail the same class. Your goal is to combat the three students and try to win the combat. At first, each of them will make you some mathematics and computer science questions. If you get more than 50% of the questions correct, you defeat them without risking your blood. If you get less than or equal to 50% of the questions correct, then you will have to fight them and risk your life to defeat those students. Your main goal is to defeat the boss, which is the Website Destroyer!

Good luck! Have fun and always prefer to risk your brain energy than your blood energy!
