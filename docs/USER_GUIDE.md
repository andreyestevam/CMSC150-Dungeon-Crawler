The Richmond Chainsaw Massacre is an academic nerd game, which will require you to bring your math and programming skills to the game (otherwise, you will have to fight for your life, instead of using your brain). The player has the opportunity to enter their own name in the beginning of the game, and choose between the three main characters:
    1. The Web Developer
    2. The Scientist
    3. The Mathematician

Each of these characters have special abilities and they will help you to solve the problems against the enemies throughout the SpiderDash 5K (explained during the instructions inside the game).

Once the game starts, you will be able to type your user name. After that, you will read about the history of the game and then select your character.
When the character is chosen, you will receive information about the character's stats and abilities (attack, defense, level, experience points (xp), and health)
It is important to remember that the level your character has is very important for the campaign since every 5 XP you earn, your level increases by 1.
After selecting your character, it's time see who are your enemies! In your screen, all your enemies' stats will appear so you can have an overview of what you are going to battle.
Once everything is set and you learned about the enemies, you will be in a grid where you can move your character around the game and go towards the enemies or get the loots! The loots give you 10 of XP and 2 of Level.
After this, it will appear the battle function, which you will be able to first answer multiple choices questions by typing A, B, or C as the alternatives. If you do not score more than 50% correct, you will have to go to the battle combat! You attack with E and defend with Q.
If your character health reaches at zero... you lose the game! If not, you will keep playing until defeat the boss, which is the Website Destroyer!
